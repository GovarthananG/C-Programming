# C-Programming
This Repository will be updated with various Technical C-Programming questions asked in the Interviews.

Program : 01 : Reverse Number
#Qns : Given a number N, print reverse of number N.
Note : Do not print leading zeros in output.
Ex : 
N = 100
Reverse of N will be 1 not 001.
Input: Input contains a single integer N.
Output: Print reverse of integer N.
Constraints:
1<=N<=10000

Program : 02 : Closest Gift
#Qns : You are on your way to find the gifts. All the gifts lie in your path in a straight line at primenumbers and your house is at 0.
Note : Given your current position find the closest gift to your position, and calculate the distance between your current position and gift and tell the distance.
Ex :
For input 0, the output is 2
For number = 11, the output should be 0
For number = 2000000000, the output should be 11 For number = 1800000001, the output should be 10

Program : 03 : Maximum Number
#Qns : Given an array of numbers, arrange them in a way that yields the largest value. For example, if the given numbers are {54, 546, 548, 60}, the arrangement 6054854654 gives the largest value.
Input:
First line contains an integer N , Next line contains N integers separated by space.
Output:
Print the maximum number that can be obtained by using given numbers.
Constraints:
1<=N<=1000
1<=Number<=1000000
